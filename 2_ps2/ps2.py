# PROBLEM 2b: Implementing load_map
def load_map(map_filename):
    """
    Parses the map file and constructs a road map (graph).

    Parameters:
        map_filename : String
            name of the map file

    Assumes:
        Each entry in the map file consists of the following format, separated by spaces:
            src_node dest_node travel_time road_type

        Note: mountain road types always are uphill in the source to destination direction and
              downhill in the destination to the source direction. Downhill travel takes
              half as long as uphill travel. The travel_time represents the time to travel 
              from source to destination (uphill).

        e.g.
            N0 N1 10 interstate
        This entry would become two directed roads; one from 'N0' to 'N1' on an interstate highway with 
        a weight of 10, and another road from 'N1' to 'N0' on an interstate using the same weight.

        e.g. 
            N2 N3 7 mountain 
        This entry would become to directed roads; one from 'N2' to 'N3' on a mountain road with 
        a weight of 7, and another road from 'N3' to 'N2' on a mountain road with a weight of 3.5.

    Returns:
        a directed road map representing the inputted map
